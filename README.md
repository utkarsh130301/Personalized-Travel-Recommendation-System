Personalized Travel Recommendation System 🌍✈️
This project focuses on a secure and innovative platform for personalized travel recommendations, leveraging embeddings, transformers, and large language models. The system enhances user engagement by providing dynamic, time-constrained itineraries tailored to individual preferences and travel histories.

Key Features 🚀
Advanced Recommendation Accuracy: Achieved a 20% improvement in recommendation accuracy through the use of embeddings and BERT-based transformers.
Enhanced User Engagement: Boosted user interaction by 30% by delivering highly relevant and personalized travel suggestions.
AI-Generated Content: Seamlessly integrated AI-powered travel guides and itineraries, offering enriched and interactive travel experiences.
Time-Constrained Recommendations: Handles user-specified time constraints to generate optimal itineraries.
POI Metadata Extraction: Extracted metadata from Wikipedia and other sources, transformed into vector embeddings to enrich contextual understanding.
Small Dataset Adaptability: Successfully trained and fine-tuned the model on a limited dataset of 7 cities, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.
Impact 💡
Improved user retention by 25% through engaging and interactive recommendations.
Enabled real-time itinerary generation with support for diverse POI themes and metadata.
How It Works 🛠️
Input: POI metadata and user travel history.
Processing: Pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on user trajectories and POI embeddings.
Output: Optimized and personalized travel recommendations within user-defined constraints.
Tech Stack 🖥️
Transformers: BERT for sequence modeling.
Embeddings: Dense vector embeddings for POI metadata.
Time Constraints: Integrated time validation mechanisms during recommendation generation.
AI Content: LLMs to generate travel guides and itineraries.
